## 1. Analysis of the information
  1) Which are the 3 different meanings which we can attribute to signs? A: onosemic, polysemic & pansemic 
  
  2) When a system is monosemic? A:  when the meaning of each sign is known prior to observation of the collection of signs.
  
  3) What are the 3 sensory  variables that the visual perception has?A: the variation of marks and the two dimensionsof the plane.
  
  4) When do the most ancient graphic representations probably date ? A: he third millennium before Christ
  
  ### A. The invariant and the components Definition
  1) In the graphic system two visual components are normally utilized. A: the two dimensions of the plane.
  
  2) How are components of the graphic sign-system knowed?. A: visual variables(or variables)
  
  3) What is graphic representation of information formed by? A: correspondences among given variables.
  
  4) What is the invariant? A: It is the complete and invariable notion common to all the data
  
  5) This specifies the common ground for different compnents that extend throughout the larger informational set being investigated or the work being consulted. A: The invariant
  
  6) In or under each image or homogenous group of images. what information should be indicated in such a way that these elements can be photographed with the drawing? A: The source, author, work, publisher, place of publication and date
  
  ### B. The number of components
  1) What is first stage in the analysis of the information? A: The determination of the number of components
  
  2) How are the different identifiable parts of a component or of a variable called? A: Elements or categories or classes or steps.
