  2) What is range? A: the ratio between the largest and smallest numbers in a statistical series.
  
  3) What length  the visual variables must have at least? A: the same lengthas the components wich they are meant to represent. 
  
  4) What does "long components" mean? A: the length exceeds some fifteen divisions
  
  ### D. The level of organization of the components
  
  1) What do graphics reprersent? A:  only the relationships established among componentsor elements.
  
  2) What are the relationships's three levels of organization? A: Qualitative level, Ordered level, Quantitative level 
  
  3) What does the quantitative level include? A: all the concepts of simple differentiation (trades, products, religions, colors .. .)
  
  4) What does perceptual approaches the quantitative level always involves? A: association and differentiation.
  
  5) What does ordered level involve? A: involves all the concepts that permit a ranking of the elements in a universally acknowledged manner. This level includes all the concepts which allow one to say: This is more than that and less than the other.
  
  6) Which is the third stage in the analysis of the information? A: The levels of organization
  
  7)  What is quantitative level ?A: it is when countable unit are used.
  
## 2. The properties of the graphic system

  ### A. The scope of the graphic system
  1) How many variables does a graphic system at its disposal has? A: 8
  
  2) What are the visual variables? A: the 2 dimensions of the plane, size, value, texture, color, orientation, and shape.
  
  3) Each one of these is characterized by its level of organization and its length. A: Variables
  
  4) This representation correspond with the third dimension. A: relief representation. 
  
  ### B. The plane
  
  1) How is the representation of the correspondences among all the elements of one component and all the elements of another component knowed? A: Diagram.
  
  2) How is the representation of the correspondences among all the elements of the same component knowed? A: Network.
  
  3) What are the three elementary figures of a plane geometry? A: Point, line and area 
  
  4) What does a point represent? a location on the plane that has no theorical length or area.
  
  5) How is the representation of the correspondences among all the elements of the same geographic component, inscribed on the plane according to the observed
geographic distribution knowed? A: Geographic map

  ### C. The retinal variables
  1) What is elevation? A: the utilization of the  variables other than retinal variables
  
  2) What is dissociative variable? A: the variables that causes the visibility of the signs to vary
  
  3) When is the quantitative perception involved? A:
    (1) When we seek to define numerically the ratio between two signs
    (2) When we seek to group homogeneous signs, that is, ones involving  small quantitative "distances", and thus define the natural steps resulting from a statistical study.
    
  4) What is value variation? A: is the continuous progression which the eye perceives in a series of grays ranging from black to white
  
## 3. The rules of the graphic system

  
  ### B. Image theory: Efficiency
  1) How is the image theory form? A: The body of remarks leading to the rules of construction
  
  2) What are the 5 aspects of image theory? A: (1) Stages in the reading process, (2) Possible questions—levels of reading,  (3) Definition of an image,  (4) Construction of an image, (5) Limits of an image
  
  3) What are the 3 three Successive operations to read a drawing? A: External identification, Internal identification and Perception of pertinent correspondences
  
  4) There are as many types of questions as components in the information, but within each type there are numerous possible question. What are these? (1) Questions introduced by a single element of a component, (2) Questions introduced by a group of elements in the component, (3) Question introduced by the whole component
  
  5) What are the three levels of reading that each type of question has? A: Elementary, Intermediate and Overall
  
  6) What is the meaningful visual form perceptible in the minimum instant of vision? A: Image
  
  ### C. Three functions of graphic representation
  
  1) A plane and its visual signs can be utilized for communicating information, in order to. A: 
  
  2) What does recording information consist of? A: To create a storage mechanism which avoids the effort of memorization. 
  
  3) What does communicating information consist of? A: to create a memorizable image which will inscribe the information in the viewer’s mind.
  
  4) What does processing information consist of? A: to furnish the drawings which permit a simplification and its justification. The graphic should be memorizable (for comparisons) and comprehensive (for choices).

  
  ### D. General rules of construction
  
  1) What is the first rule of graphic construction? A:To represent the information in a single image, or in the minimum numberof images necessary
  
  2) This involves a continuing effort of comparison. A: Knowledge.
  
  3) What do the rules of construction define? A: The most efficient construction for a given Case.
  
  4) What are the 3 gemeral rules of graphic construction? A: (1) To represent the information in a single image, (2) To simplify the image without reducing the number of
correspondences, (3) To simplify the image by reduction


  ### E. General rules of legibility (or rules of separation)
  
  1) What is the importac of legibility? A:It permit us to best accomplish sensory differentiation
  
  2) Which is the maximum limit of the legibility of a figuration? A:Ten signs per cm’
  
  3) How does angular legibility decrease?: (1) as the clearness diminishes (2) as the angle approaches 0 degreesor 180 degrees (3) as the lines forming the angle shorten.
  
  4) What are the three distinct shapes with smaller sizes ? A: the point, the dash and the intersection of two dashes
